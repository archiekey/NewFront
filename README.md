Readme for Archana Venkatesh newfront Code Challenge.
====================================================

1.	I have completed the following shapes along with test cases packaged as Junit test suite.
    a.	Rectangle and
    b.	Circle
2.	I have implemented methods to create, delete, move and resize these shapes. I am also handling collisions resulting from these operations.
3.	These shapes can be added to a space and managed within that space.
4.	My test cases and test suite should provide details about how to use these classes.
5.	I believe all other shapes can be implemented in a similar manner. The complexity and time-consuming work on implementing new shapes is to get the mathematics behind detecting collision. But with some more time, I can get this done.
6.	I have uploaded the zip file containing newfrontshapes.jar along with other junit jar files that are needed to run junit test suite and test cases into github.
7.	The uploaded newfrontshapes.jar file has class files as well as the source java files. Please use the following command to extract all files from the jar. (jar xvf <filename>)
8.	Use the following process to execute all testsâ€¦
    a.	Extract the zip file onto a directory.
    b.	From that directory execute the following command to run all tests..
        java -classpath ".:junit-4.13-rc-1.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:newfrontshapes.jar"  org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ShapesTest.AllTests
9.  Let me know if you need any clarifcations or require me to do anything more on this.
10. On Wednesday, November 20th, I implemented the Triangle shape and updated the test casses to test this shape as well. I also updated the Github with this change.
